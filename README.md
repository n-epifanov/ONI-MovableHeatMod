# ONI-MovableHeatMod
Mod for Oxygen not Included.
It sets Overheat Temperature to 1000 C for all Liquid and Gas pumps, Thermo Regulator and Thermo Aquatuner.
This allows to move heat at a wider range of temperatures, e.g. to dump excess heat into Steam Turbine
(there's another mod to make Steam Turbine usable see https://github.com/nicktime/ONI-EasySteamTurbineMod).
